## User Stories

### Setup Stories
```
HSE-001: As a developer, I want to integrate CoreUI React into the .NET 8 solution
Given I have the existing .NET 8 solution
When I run the setup commands
Then CoreUI React should be properly integrated in the ClientApp folder
And both frontend and backend should run with a single command

HSE-002: As a developer, I want automated TypeScript type generation
Given I have C# DTOs in my API
When I run the type generation script
Then TypeScript interfaces should be created automatically
And API calls should have full type safety
```

### Domain Model Stories
```
HSE-003: As an architect, I want HSE domain models with audit support
Given I need to track all HSE entities
When I create domain models
Then each entity should have audit fields (CreatedBy, CreatedAt, ModifiedBy, ModifiedAt)
And soft delete should be implemented

HSE-004: As a compliance officer, I want Indonesian regulatory fields
Given Indonesian law requires specific HSE reporting
When I design the database schema
Then incidents table should include BPJS and Ministry of Manpower fields
And regulatory deadlines should be automatically calculated
```

### Authentication Stories
```
HSE-005: As a user, I want secure authentication
Given I need to access the HSE system
When I login with valid credentials
Then I should receive a JWT token
And the token should work for both API and React app

HSE-006: As an admin, I want role-based access control
Given different users have different permissions
When I assign roles to users
Then access to features should be restricted based on roles
And unauthorized access should return 403 Forbidden
```

### Localization Stories
```
HSE-007: As an Indonesian user, I want the interface in Bahasa Indonesia
Given I prefer Bahasa Indonesia
When I toggle the language selector
Then all UI text should switch to Indonesian
And the preference should be saved

HSE-008: As a developer, I want maintainable translations
Given we support multiple languages
When I add new UI text
Then I should use translation keys
And missing translations should fallback to English
```
